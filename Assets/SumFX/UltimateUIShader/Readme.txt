Ultimate Unlit & UI

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A* How can I create a new "Ultimate Unlit & UI" material ?
----
1 - Create a new material by right clicking in "Project" window and by selecting: Create > Material.
2 - Select the material that you have just created.
3 - In the inspector window click the "Shader" drop-down menu and select the "SumFX > Ultimate Unlit-UI".
4 - You are now ready to use this material on your UI. (B*)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B* How can I apply "Ultimate Unlit & UI" material to my "Unity UI Raw Image" component?
----
1 - Create a new "Raw Image" object in your UI by selecting "Create > UI > Raw Image" from the "Hierarchy" window menu.
2 - Select your texture as usual in "Raw Image" component.
3 - Select the material you created before. (A*)
4 - Now you can create and customize effects for this new "Raw Image". You should do this through the selected material's own "Inspector" window.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C* Can I use same material for multiple objects?
----
1 - If you want to share exact same looking on multiple objects, then sure you can use the same material for them. 
2 - Please note; you are giving effects from the materials itself. So if you change an effect on material, it will be changed on all objects that the material applied.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D* Should I select "Base Layer (Main Texture)" for material?
----
1 - If you use this material for UI elements: No. It will be automatically applied by the Raw Image component.

E* I still have question(s)?
----
1 - IT'S OK! You can always contact with me by info@sumfx.net email address.
